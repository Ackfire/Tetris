# RPG project :desktop_computer:

## Done by Melissa, Maxime and Romain - Epitech 2022 :mortar_board:

This project is a part of the **first** year of Epitech. <br>
We had **2 month** to complete it. :spiral_calendar: <br>

The goal of this project is recreate a **Tetris game** in **C** with the **Ncurses library**. :video_game:<br>

To try this program, you need to use this **command**: <br>

```bash
make && ./tetris --key-left 68 --key-right 67 --key-drop 66 --key-turn 65 -map-size=20,20 && make fclean
```

An output you can get from this program can be:
